# Triplecheck.io
**The Magento Code Scoring tool**

Triplecheck.io is an experimental CI tool built specifically for Magento and currently still in
development. To showcase and test part of the functionality we downloaded most of the
extensions available in Magento Connect so that we could “score” them.  

We built this tool to help our own development teams write better quality code, which as we all
know reduces probability of bugs and improves maintainability.

Triplecheck.io took the shape of a Magento Connect extension scoring site, one feature that was
constantly request was the availiby to run locally and run against full magento projects.
